# Homework6
Due: October 12, 11.59pm

In this homework, you will practice:
- Writing recursive methods
- Using inheritance
- Implementing interfaces Comparable and Comparator

Click on the link on Canvas (under Assignments/Homework 6) to get the starter code for this assignment. 
You are required to use the provided starter code.

The starter code is in the package main, the tests are in package test. In package main, there are three packages: employee, recursion and shapes.
You need to fill in code in the following classes:
In package employee:
- Employee
- Company

In package recusion:
- RecursiveStringUtil

In package shapes:
- Circle
- Parallelogram
- ConvexRegularPolygon
- AreaComparator
- PerimeterComparator
- NameComparastor
- ShapeSorter
Please refer to javadoc for the description of each method. Note that some methods must be written according to certain requirements
(read javadoc carefully). Do NOT change the signatures of the methods (type and number of parameters) or the tests.

## Testing
Some basic tests have been provided to you (you can run all tests by running Homework6Tester), 
but you are responsible for further testing your code. Passing all tests does not mean there are no bugs in your code!

## Submission instructions
- Your code must (a) compile without any errors, (b) run, (c) pass the tests and (d) implement each method correctly according to the javadoc. 
 If the code does not compile or crashes when we run it on a lab machine, it will result in a 0 for the assignment. 
- This is a bigger homework, so you are required to commit and push code to github every day; at least 6 commits (not counting mine) are 
required  to  get credit for this assignment.
 - Your code needs to be committed to the correct github repository created by Github classroom (when you follow the link on Canvas). 
 Note that we cannot accept code submitted via Canvas or email. 
- Make sure your code follows the style guidelines described in StyleGuidelines.pdf (posted on Canvas) to avoid losing points.
- This assignment is individual, no collaboration is allowed. You can go the professor, the TA or CS tutors for help. 
- Please note that you are not allowed to use the web for completing this assignment, except for using Java 8 API and instructor's examples and notes. 
Looking at solutions or partial solutions on the web (even if you don't submit this code!) is considered cheating.
